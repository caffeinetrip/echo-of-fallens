## 🎬 Development Journey

This was my first Ludum Dare experience, and it was quite the adventure! With only 3 days and about 5 hours of sleep total, I managed to create a complete game from concept to release.

### What Went Well
- Successfully implemented the "depth" theme through both gameplay and narrative
- Created an atmospheric horror experience that resonated with players
- Learned the power of ModernGL for creating visually striking effects
- Completed a playable game within the strict time constraints

### Lessons Learned
1. **Scope Management:** I planned too many features and couldn't finish everything, skipping the crucial polishing stage
2. **Player Perspective:** Some systems (like random generation) might go unnoticed if players don't replay the game multiple times
3. **Time Allocation:** Focus on what players will actually see and experience first
